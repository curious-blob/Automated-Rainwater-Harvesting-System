 Algorithm
 
i.   Required header file <Servo.h> is included.
     This library allows an Arduino board to control RC (hobby) servo motors. Servos have integrated gears and a shaft that can be precisely 
     controlled. Standard servos allow the shaft to be positioned at various angles, usually between 0 and 180 degrees. Continuous rotation 
     servos allow the rotation of the shaft to be set to various speeds.

ii.  Initial position of servo motor is set to 0.

iii. The first water sensor (waterSens) is connected to pin A0. The function of this water sensor is to open the inlet once it starts 
     detecting water and close it once water can no longer be detected.

iv.  The second sensor (waterSens2) is connected to pin A1.
     The function of this sensor is to only close the inlet when it starts detecting water i.e., overflow condition. This sensor is ideally
     placed inside the container, positioned at the edge.

v.   Water level readings of the two sensors can be observed on the serial monitor.

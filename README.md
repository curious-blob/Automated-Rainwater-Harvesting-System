# automated-rainwater-harvesting-system
This project focuses on encouraging the use of rainwater harvesting in urban areas by modernizing this practice using IOT. 

The set-up although built to suit small-scale endeavors can also work on large scale provided the fundamental essence of the system is incorporated. 
Hardware Components used:
   1) Arduino Uno R3
   2) Water Sensor
   3) Servo motor
   4) Male-female jumper wires
